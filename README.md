Hi, The game has been deployed for web2 in mobile platform before. I refactored the code by changing the buttons removing redudant codes, changing code logic and added thirdweb wallet and smart contract integration.

If there is an incorrect client ID in the thirdwebmanager, There will be error that "Incorrect API key". I think this error can be misleading, so it will bw better if it is replaced with "Incorrect ClientID".

Overall, Sean Watase videos in Thiedweb youtube channel is really helpful. Great job sir.
